# Module 1: Communication in a Connected World

## Data Transmission

### Types of Personal Data
- Volunteered Data: This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. (E.g. video files, pictures, texts, or audio files.)
- Inferred Data: This is data such as credit score, based on the analysis of volunteered or observed data.
- Observed Data: This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using phones. (E.g. Your phone keeps track of your location and the data is being transmitted and stored to your carrier.)

### The Bit
- A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states ("0", "1").
With ASCII, each character is represented by 8 bits, as follows:
- Capital letter: A = 01000001
- Number: 9 = 00111001
- Special character: # = 00100011

- Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic wavelength.

- Electrical Signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire
- Optical Signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless Signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through air.
