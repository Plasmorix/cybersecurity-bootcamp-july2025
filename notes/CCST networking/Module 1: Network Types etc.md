# Module 1: Communication in a Connected World

## Data Transmission

### Types of Personal Data
- Volunteered Data: This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. (E.g. video files, pictures, texts, or audio files.)
- Inferred Data: This is data such as credit score, based on the analysis of volunteered or observed data.
- Observed Data: This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using phones. (E.g. Your phone keeps track of your location and the data is being transmitted and stored to your carrier.)

### The Bit
- A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states ("0", "1").
With ASCII, each character is represented by 8 bits, as follows:
- Capital letter: A = 01000001
- Number: 9 = 00111001
- Special character: # = 00100011

- Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic wavelength.

- Electrical Signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire
- Optical Signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless Signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through air.

## Clients and Servers

### Clients and Server Roles
- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.
- Hosts can send and receive message on the network.
- Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information (e.g. email, web pages) to other hosts on the network.
- Each service requires a separate server software:
  - Email: The email server runs email server software. CLients use mail client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, to access email on the server.
  - Web: The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software, such as Windows Internet Explorer, to access web pages on the server.
  - File: The file server stores corporate and user files in a central location. The client devices access these files with client software such as the Windows File Explorer.

### Peer-to-Peer Networks
- Client and server software usually run on separate computers.
- When a singular computer as the server and client on the network, it is called **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**.
- Example: 
    The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simple network to exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary.
- Advantages:
  - Easy to set up
  - Less complex
  - Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
  - Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers
- Disadvantages:
  - No centralized administration
  - Not as secure
  - Not scalable
  - All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.

### Peer-to-Peer Applications
- A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication.
- Example:
    Every client is a server and every server is a client. (Person A send a message to Person B. Person B receives the message. Person B sends a message back. Person A receives the message...)
- Both clients can simultaneously send and receive messages.

### Multiple Roles in the Network
