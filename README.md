# Cybersecurity Bootcamp: 28 June - 29 July 2025

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Nachiket Patel, a final year Bachelor of Cyber Security student based in Melbourne, Australia. This GitHub repository will consist of my public learning log and portfolio as I dedicate a complete month (28 June to 29 June) to build as many skills as possible, complete certifications, and work through practical labs and projects.

## Goals
This bootcamp will be solely focused on the **Cisco's cybersecurity track**. I will be working through official Cisco courses available on **NetAcad** and **SkillsForAll**, aiming for certifications which align with entry-level/graduate cyber roles.

## Certifications/Paths:
- Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) - Networking *(in progress)*
- Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) - Cybersecurity 
- Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (CBROPS - 200-201)
- Cisco Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Path
- [Optional: CCNA]

## Projects:
- SOC Incident Investigation (PCAP + log analysis report)
- Threat Hunting Simulation (Nmap, syslog, attack path mapping)
- Identity and Access Control Demo (role-based simulation, auth logging)
